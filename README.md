**Abstract**:

Acoustic measurements are prone to external noises consisting of stationary background noise and non-stationary contamination. In principle, the repeated measurements can be performed and then averaged such that the resulting signal-to-noise ratio is improved. However, averaging leads to poor rejection of high-energy disturbances, and in the case of time-variant environment, causes attenuation at high frequencies. This paper proposes a robust method in combining repeated measurements to recover a clean signal by using across-measurement median filtering in time and frequency domains. Using median successfully rejects non-stationary noise, suppresses background noise, and is more robust towards time-variation than averaging.
